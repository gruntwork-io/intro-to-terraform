  # This module is now only being tested with Terraform 0.14.x. However, to make upgrading easier, we are setting
  # 0.12.26 as the minimum version, as that version added support for required_providers with source URLs, making it
  # forwards compatible with 0.14.x code.
  required_version = ">= 0.12.26"

# NOTE: All the important code for this example is in outputs.tf.
